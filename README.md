# hundred_prisoner_puzzle

This script is inspired by the video of Verasitum about [the hundred prisoner riddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA).
It is possible to either simulate a single game and show how many prisoners found their number or to simulate several games and print the winning ratio of the prisoners.
